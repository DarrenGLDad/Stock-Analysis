# Stock-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to refactor the code previously used in the module. I wanted to see if refactoring the code would make the script run faster and if it would be more efficient. I also included the entire stock market when completing the refactor instead of the dozen stocks which were used before.

## Results
The stock performance was better in 2017 with almost all stocks being in the positive. The only stock that was negative in 2017 was TERP. While TERP continued being in the negative in 2018 it increased from -7.2% in 2017 to -5.0% in 2018. In 2018 10 out of the 12 stocks dipped with DQ dipping the lowest with a return of -62.6%. The biggest increase for 2018 was RUN with a return of 84% which was a huge increase compared to the 5.5% return they had in 2017.

## Summary

I had some trouble with interpreting the logic when refactoring the code. The disadvantages would be that I needed to make sure that I went back and changed the correct letters used in my for loops. I had a few mismatches and it took me some time to figure out which lines were incorrect. I also seemed to spend a lot refactoring the code to make sure every line that needed updating was done correctly.
